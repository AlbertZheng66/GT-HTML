 I believe that the best and efficient way to access the capability of a software engineer is to read his source code, so I put my work here, which is written on my spare time.

I am passionate about programming and spend countless weekends on improving programming skills and learning the fundamental theories of information technology.

I guess that there are some points that I should point out in advance. 

<UL>
<LI>First, the projects were started several years ago, which means that they would not completely represent my levels now. I have been learning new tricks and programming languages continually. However, I hope that it would help you know me better. 
</LI>
</br>
<LI>Second, they are not only &quot;for-fun&quot;
projects but practical work. Most of the open source projects were contributed to my previous companies and are applied in various projects.

Third, I do not have enough time to translate the Chinese comments to English. Sorry for the inconvenience.

<H3> OVERVIEW </H3>
<DIV>
	This project was finished in 2009 and is based on a simple idea â€“ how to simplify the process of web development, to make maintenance easier, and improve developers' efficiency. Developers could only use JavaScript and Java to complete their projects, rather than JSP, various frameworks, taglib, and template engines(such as velocity), and complex configuration.  
</DIV>

</br>
<DIV>
	There are only several JavaScript files in the client side, which are used to retrieve data from server, to render components dynamically, to format the number and time fields, to parse annotations, to process exceptions from the server, and to bind a bean to a form.
</DIV>


</br>
<DIV>
	What is more important is that  it could tremendously reduce the complexity of development. I'd like to use graphs below to illustrate the differences between old-school web development and my style of web development.
